# SixFlags Park Hours

A couple reasons for this project:

* Generate an ICS calendar subscription file.
* View the park hours in a compact month view.

The park hours are generated directly from the SixFlags API (see below). A GitHub action runs daily to fetch and update the park hours and publish the GitHub Page.

Hope this is useful to you. Feel free to open an issue or suggest an improvement.
